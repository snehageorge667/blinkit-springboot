# blinkit-springboot
This is a Spring Boot–based Blinkit Grocery Search project that loads grocery data from a CSV file into PostgreSQL and provides REST APIs to search items by name, category, or description. It uses Spring Data JPA for database operations, Gradle for build management, and includes a simple web page for item search. Once the application starts, the CSV data is imported automatically, and users can access the search UI or test the APIs through endpoints. The project is lightweight, easy to extend, and serves as a basic grocery management and search system.
